                        HOPE

The day is dark and way seems narrow at the entrance of the pandemic, survival was the next thought of the mind.

To avoid ditch fall, men were isolated, quarantined in their respective homes, in their own comfort. Some people get to listen well, mediate well, rest more, exercise better, bond firmly, get more creative.

At the longrun, some get bored, depression about to set in, hunger knocking at the door.

Rejoice, the hope is here, men get healed, thanking God for breathe,grateful for life, comforted for the loss of loved ones.

Yes the hope is here, Yes,You are the Hope. You are the hope! You are bold and fearless, you are anxious for nothing, your gaze are set on things above, you are strong and you communicate strength.

Yes, You! The fragrance of your smile and laughter ligthen up the world,i mean, You,your heart is guidede by his words, you are not comfortless.

Radiate your light to others, their healing lies in those encouraging words, on those love and outstretched arms of comfort, healing falls on people, the world rejoice as we build a world of hope free from the Pandemic Covid 19.

STAY SAFE
